First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:

- [How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf)

Then, install this module from pypi using `pip3` (or `pip2` for Python 2):

```
pip3 install face_recognition
```

Alternatively, you can try this library with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), see [this section](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/README.md#deployment).

If you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out a [pre-configured VM](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b).
